Oh, the pleasure is all mine.
Anyway, there’s a door up ahead that’s locked and I can’t seem to get it open.
I found this weapon lying around and I think it may be able to blast open the door.
Problem is, I can’t seem to get the thing to work.
It keeps telling me that I haven’t sacrificed enough yet.
I’m so weak that I can barely move so I don’t think there’s much i can give up.
But you two, you two look nice and strong!
Frank, I can’t help but notice that you can fly.
If it’s ok with you, I can extract that power and funnel it into this gun.
(Don’t worry, it’s relatively painless.)
And you, PLAYER.
From where I’m standing, it looks like you have plenty of things you can sacrifice all around you.
I realize you're in a slightly different dimension, but I think I have a workaround.
You can mail something to 325 East 64th Street New York NY 10065
It can be anything really, just something that holds any sort of value to you.
I can have an associate transfer the items power to me in this dimension.
I know it’s a lot to ask, but I think if we work together we can both get outta here alive.
Go ahead and jump into me when your ready to start the sacrifice process.
